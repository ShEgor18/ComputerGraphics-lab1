# Computer graphics: Image processing

## Introduction

Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm. 
As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. 
It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and distortion during processing.

## Tasks to complete:
